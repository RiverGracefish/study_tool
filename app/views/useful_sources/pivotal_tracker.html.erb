<h1>Pivotal Tracker</h1>

<h3>Intro to Pivotal Tracker</h3>
<h4>Tracker is a tool to allow you to keep track of what you are working on</h4>
<p>We will be using this to provide you a list of "stories" that need to be done</p>
<p>All Homework will be assigned in this way</p>
<output>Sometimes we will give you stories to import</output>
<output>Sometimes you will need to write your own stories</output>
<output>If it needs to be done, put it in your tracker project!</output>

<h3>Let's get started</h3>
<h4><%= link_to 'Visit http://www.pivotaltracker.com/sigin', 'http://www.pivotaltracker.com/sigin' %></h4>
<h4><button>LOGIN OR SIGN UP</button> with your username/password</h4>
<h4>Click <button>CREATE PROJECT</button></h4>
<P>On the pop up window, type in your project name and pick account type</P>

<h3>Tracker Overview</h3>
<h4>Icebox</h4>
<p>Stories that are not yet scheduled/prioritized</p>
<p>Useful for "don't forget XXXX" type stories</p>
<p>Make sure stories are fully "actionable" before moving them to the Backlog</p>
<p>Click the <button>+ Add Story</button> and enter some text, new stories go to the Icebox by default</p>
<h4>Backlog</h4>
<p>List of stories that are ready to be worked on</p>
<p>Stories are listed in Prioritized Order</p>
<p>You can click and drag stories from the Icebox to the Backlog</p>
<p>Estimating stories gives them a point value</p>
<p>When you are ready to start a story, look in the Backlog for the next available story</p>
<h4>Current</h4>
<p>Stories that are currently being worked on</p>
<p>When you <button>Start</button> a story, if it was in the Backlog, it is moved to Current</p>
<p>Green background means the story is accepted</p>
<p>Yellow background means it is in a state between Started and Accepted</p>
<p>White means it has not yet been started</p>
<h4>Done</h4>
<p>Stories that were accepted in past iterations</p>
<p>Iterations are 1-3 weeks of work</p>
<p>All stories in this section will be Green(Accepted)</p>
<p>If you don't see this section, go to More ==> Done</p>
<h4>We will not cover the following</h4>

<h3>Adding a Tracker Story</h3>
<h4>Click <button>+ Add Story</button> to add a new story</h4>
<p>Story title is a short description of what the story should accomplish</p>
<p>Story Type:</p>
<output>Feature --New functionality</output>
<output>Bug --Problem with existing functionality</output>
<output>Chore --Something that needs doing that isn't a Feature or Bug</output>
<output>Release --A release of the software you are creating</output>
<h4>Requester is who is requesting the feature or found the bug</h4>
<h4>Owner is who has taken ownership for fixing or implementing the story</h4>
<h3>Usually leave this blank unless a member of your team has specific knowledge about the story</h3>
<h4>Description is a detailed description of exactly what is being requested and what will need to be accomplished before this story can be accepted</h4>
<h4>Good descriptions have steps to reproduce, or sign off requirements included</h4>
<h4>Labels allow you to mark a story as related to a group of other stories</h4>
<h4>Tasks are usually used by the developer to make sure they don't forget to do something while finishing this story</h4>
<h4>Activity are notes and comments on the story. You can attach screen shots, sample date, etc.</h4>

<h3>Tracker Workflow</h3>
<h4>After a story or stories are added to the Icebox, the group of developers who will work on that story should meet and go over the story requirements</h4>
<h4>After going over the requirements, the developers will assign each Feature a point value. 1 point stories are much easier than 3 point stories.</h4>
<h4>When a developer wants to work on something, they will check for the next story that has yet been started.</h4>
<h4>They click <button>Start</button> to start that story, which changes the Owner field to them and the story status to <button>Started</button></h4>
<h4>The developer would then create a branch (covered in detail later) and start working on this feature/bug</h4>
<h4>After a developer is finished with the work for a story, they will open a Pull Request(PR) and add the PR URL as a comment on the story</h4>
<h4>They will then click the <button>Finish</button> which shows the developer feels this story is finished</h4>
<h4>When the PR is accepted, the story should be marked as Delivered, which sends the Requester an Email asking them to verify the story functionality</h4>
<h4>After the Requester verifies the functionality, they have two options:</h4>
<p>Accept: Story will be marked as accepted.</p>
<p>Reject: 1) Story will be marked as rejected;</p>
<p>2) Requester should add a comment specifying what caused them to reject the story.</p>
<h4>If a story is accepted, the developer has nothing left to do for that story</h4>
<h4>If a story is rejected, the developer should restart that story and fix the issues the Requester identified</h4>
<p>After these changes are made, the developer should open another PR and click <button>Finish</button> just like they did the first time through.</p>
<h4>Features and Bugs follow the workflow described</h4>
<h4>Chores do not have a sign off state, so they are simply started, then <button>Accepted</button> when they are done</h4>
<p>Releases only have Unstarted and Accepted states</p>

<h3>Tracker Usage in Class</h3>
<h4>You will be using Pivotal Tracker in class to keep track of your homework assignments</h4>
<h4>Start stories in the order they are prioritized</h4>
<h4>Finish stories as you create pull requests</h4>
<h4>Stories should be marked as delivered once the PR is merged</h4>
<h4>You should not mark your own stories accepted (TAs or Instructor will)</h4>
